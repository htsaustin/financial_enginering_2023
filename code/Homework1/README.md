Homework 1: Implement CRR formula. 

Not confident this works as expected. For a set of params, comparing with the Example 7 code, we get differing results.
It _looks_ like the results may converge for large N, but I haven't confirmed.

Suggested params for testing:
S0 = 100
U = 0.05
D = -0.05
N = 5
K = 110
